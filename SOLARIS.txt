You must install a newer version of Screen.  Get it here:

  http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/screen/screen-4.2.1.tar.gz

This must appear in your path before the system version.

export CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -D_XOPEN_SOURCE -D_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED=1 -D__EXTENSIONS__" 
./configure
./gmake


FWIW, you can't build the current tree.  But some hints to try:

To build current git tree, you need autoconf package (pkg install autoconf),
automake-110 . To search for pkgs, you can "pkg search /usr/local/foo*"
gcc-48, system/header is also useful.
